## üëã Hi ! I'm Siddharth Chillale



- :water_buffalo: I completed my Masters in Computer Science at University at Buffalo with specialization in Low-Level Computer Systems.
- :camera: My topics of interest(but not limited to) are 
  * Low-level software systems and optimization.
  * Data Engineering and Networking
  * Cloud Engineering
  * Web development 
  

I love reading books, programming, and books on programming. I also draw, paint and admire art of any kind. I play Table Tennis, Badminton and I like to think I'm good at it :p! My innate driving force is exploration and curiosity to understand the world and my place in it. I constantly try to seek out experiences that I've never had before. 
Ping me on any of my social to chat with me üôÇ !!

üìä **Current Projects Lists**
<!--START_SECTION:waka-->
- &check; - 2D C++ game development [link](https://github.com/SiddharthChillale/snek_game)
  - Wrote a C++ game from scratch featuring a snake who can eat food to grow longer and snacks to move faster. Used WinAPI for window creation and coloring graphics. Implemented primitives like lines, triangles and quads. 
- &check; - Software Offline Ray Tracer [link](https://github.com/SiddharthChillale/Ray_Tracer)
  - Wrote a ray tracer following the raytracing series of three books by Peter Shirley. Includes acceleration using bounding volume hierarchical structures of AABBs, volume rendering, direct and indirect light illumination using BRDF model, Texture and image mapping. A Z-Buffer is used to determine the order of drawing overlapping triangles. 
- &check; - DirectX Deferred Rendering [link](https://github.com/SiddharthChillale/cofe-3d-renderer)
  - Developed a 3D renderer using DirectX for deferred rendering. Features include dynamic Phong shading with specular highlights, mesh loading, texture mapping with mipmaps, frustum culling. 
- [ ] - Realtime DirectX Raytracing (future)
- [ ] - Exploration of CPU-Multithreading and uses in applictions. Currently practisiing with Leetcode Concurrency problems.
- [ ] - SFML application for demonstrating different sampling techniques like Poisson-Disk sampling, Importance Sampling, Uniform Sampling, Random Sampling.
- [ ] - Neural Rendering (future)
