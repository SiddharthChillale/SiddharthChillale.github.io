1. Shading Traingles and interpolating normals for smoother 

**What I've learnt**: 
- Rendering Triangles through rasterization
- Model loading with normals
- Texture Mapping
- Blinn-Phong shading model
- Direct3D 11 Pipeline for rasterization which includes
  - Vertex Shader
  - Pixel Shader
  - Geometry Shader
- Camera motion control 
  
**What could be improved** : 
- Normal Mapping for textures 
- Instancing of models
- Better Scene representation
- Extensive control over model objects and scene lights
