In that time, the object is sampled at some random intervals and the aggregate of all these samples is added up to give the final image of the object. This results in the object rendered as blurred due to motion. While this effect can be achieved in screenspace, a way to achieve it in-camera is shown here, I believe, to introduce the idea of timed-rays (or rays having temporal existence). However, this implementation does have shortcomings though.

As our application is single thread on CPU, the boost in the performance is negligible for our simple scenes. How BVH works is that we try to eliminate the most occuring case as fast as possible. The most occuring case being that the object is NOT hit by the ray. Till now, we send a ray through every pixel of the screen. This ray is check for intersection with spheres that collectively make up our scene. It seems rather unnecessary that we have to do the complicated ray-sphere intersection tests for every single ray. We can reduce the time-consuming math if we can somehow eliminate the cases where there is a 100% chance that the ray will not hit the sphere. This is achieved rather cleverly, by using bounding boxes. Axis Aligned Bounding Box or AABB tests are fast to calculate. How this goes is that we create a tight enveloping box around our primitives(spheres in this case) that is aligned wrt to the camera coordinate axis. (citation need for the last part). Calculating ray-box intersections is simple to implement as well as to calculate. . Now preparing one box per sphere is good, but if you have hundred spheres,, calculating hundred AABB tests throws us back to out original problem and things get slow again. To overcome this, boxes that are close to other boxes can be grouped up to create a larger box that envelopes the two AABBs, This generates a tree of bounding box heirarchies that becomes easier to calculate. When an intersection with a AABB occurs, the ray then checks if there is an intersection with any of its children, and recurses its way through to ultimately do ray-sphere intersection tests.\nSolid Texture Mapping We create a texture class. this is attached to an object’s material and acts as its base color.
