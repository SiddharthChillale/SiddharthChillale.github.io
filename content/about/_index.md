Hi, I am ***Siddharth Chillale*** or "Sid" in short.

I'm a graduate student pursing Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY. Over a period of my undergraduate, I developed my skills in data science and training simple machine learning models. My love for pulling insights from raw data led me to develop a dashboard running data analysis and showcasing affected numbers during the COVID-19 crisis in early March 2020.

My latest web app project is a dashboard running data analysis and showcasing affected numbers during the COVID-19 crisis.

Apart from my academics, I'm working on helping with the COVID research by running models on the gathered data.

Recently, I volunteered as a Teaching Assistant at "ShiP.py: Learning to Py while Shelter-in-Place" to offer a Free, Online, Interactive, and Hands-on beginner's programming course in Python.

In my free time, I continue to improve my knowledge on graphics programming.
